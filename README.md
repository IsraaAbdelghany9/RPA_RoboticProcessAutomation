# RPA_RoboticProcessAutomation

This repository showcases a collection of RPA (Robotic Process Automation) projects built using UiPath. Each project automates real-world tasks such as web data extraction, file handling, desktop interaction, and report generation. Both Classic and Modern UiPath experiences are used to demonstrate practical RPA workflows.
